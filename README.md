# Sillago-Sihama-Vid
Fish behaviour analysis plays an important role in managing fish farms. Here, we provide an extensive Sillago sihama fish dataset for behaviour analysis via tracking. The dataset contains  a total of 16 videos, split into training and testing.  The fish tracking annotations are provided in Pascal VOC format. Further, several different behaviour patterns of the fishes are observed in the dataset such as frantic, hiding, no movement and swimming at the surface patterns.  An efficient tracking algorithm directly influences the performance of fish behaviour analysis. Fish behaviour detection model can provide greater insights regarding the fishes thereby helping the piscators to better manage the fish farms.
