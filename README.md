# Sillago-Sihama-Vid:
Fish behaviour analysis plays an important role in managing fish farms in aquaculture. The lack of fish datasets for their behaviour analysis has limited the growth of computer-vision based technologies in aquaculture. Here, we provide an extensive Sillago sihama fish dataset for behaviour analysis via tracking. The dataset contains  a total of 16 videos, split into training (8) and testing (8).  The fish trajectory annotations are provided in Pascal VOC format. The dataset contains 8 to 10 fishes in an aquarium. We have strictly followed MOT16 annotation rules to create the dataset. We have emulated the natural environment of the fish in the aquarium to capture the normal behaviour of the fishes (Sillago sihama). Studying the behaviour patterns can provide greater insights regarding the fish, thereby enabling better management of the fish farms.
